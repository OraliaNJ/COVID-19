/*This is contains the extraction Data for 79 record days.
The hierarquical data is divided in first step the patients whose tested positive to the virus (Figure 1), in second stage, this data was divided in two categories:
(H) Hospitalized Patient and (NH) Non-Hospitalized Patients, finally the each category was sectionad in 5 Mexico's regions: United Mexican States of Northwest Region (R1), United
Mexican States of Northeast Region (R2), United Mexican States of West Region (R3), United Mexican States of Central Region (R4) and United Mexican
States of Southeast Region (R5).*/

- Figure 1: Methodology and Network database were constructed hierarchical variables identified by 5 different colors as follows: maroon, orange, blue, green and purple.
- Figure 2: Age distributions of H and NH patients in R1 for 10 days.
- Figure 3: Boxplot of the 5 Mexico’s regions grouped by the 9 comorbidities, the top graph is from NH patients values and the bottom graph is form H patients.
- Figure 4: Correlation’s sub-matrices, the top matrix constitutes the positive correlation and the bottom matrix the negative correlation.
- Figure 5: SuperHeat map describes the density relationship between the comorbidities, N and NH patients in the Regions of M´exico during the 79 days with the pandemic.
- Figure 6: Bayesian Network cofiguration for calculate the Probability Analysis.
